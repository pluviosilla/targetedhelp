                      currently have four categories: The Poor, The Sick, Ministries and Microbusinesses, but we plan
                      to offer more. Suggest a new one to us!</p>
                      <p>TargetedHelp.org is a new concept that is long overdue - bringing giving into the Information Age.
                      By giving directly to those in need, we cut the cost of giving to a minimum and empower charitable
                      organizations with a &quot;presence on the ground&quot; to focus on their more vital role of collecting
                      information. </p>
